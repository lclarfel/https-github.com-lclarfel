We build a foundation for developing and training deep learning models. First, we will provide a brief overview of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning (DL). Second, we will take a deeper dive into neural networks by examining their graphical and mathematical structure. Third, we will introduce gradient descent (GD) optimization, which is the fundamental algorithm used to train neural network models. Fourth, we will apply our understanding of GD to the training of neural networks, describe the role of data in training, evaluating model performance, how to troubleshoot problems encountered during training, and an overall strategy for model training. We will use demonstrations and examples in Python to illustrate these concepts and the related workflows. Finally, we will explore examples of regression and classification using TensorFlow and PyTorch on HPC systems.
