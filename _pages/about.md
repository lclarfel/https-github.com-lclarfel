*Draft - In progress*

Hi! I'm Larry and I am a "data naturalist". My unique background is grounded in three pillars: 

1. Ecology and Natural History
2. Data Science and Machine Learning
3. Teaching and Public Outreach

Ecology and Natural History
------

I am a lifelong naturalist with an endless curiosity for all things nature. I’ve pursued this passion through decades of working, volunteering, and recreating in natural spaces and documenting their biodiversity through field-based monitoring. I’m particularly knowledgeable about birds and herps but have a broader interest in understanding how different species interact to form robust and resilient ecosystems. 

Data Science and Machine Learning
------

I’ve always loved math and have found computing to be a wonderful vehicle for applying my quantitative skills to understanding the world. My diverse doctoral work in computer science involved quantifying the risk to electric power grids from cascading failures and using natural language processing to analyze conversations between healthcare providers and patients with serious illness. Currently, I’m using my expertise in computing to build software tools and conduct research that supports remote wildlife monitoring.

Teaching and Public Outreach
------

For over a decade, I worked at community nature centers in Ossining, NY and Montpelier, VT, connecting people of all ages with the natural world. It is critically important to educate people as to the value of nature, helping to instill a reverence for the diversity of life with which we share our planet. I’ve led birding and natural history trips across the northeastern US (and internationally) and continue to give public talks periodically. Please contact me for inquiries.
